### **3. Balance Strategy: The Rule of 3 Tiers**

- **Daily Practice:** 1 low-reward hobby — a grounding ritual (e.g., journaling or walking)
- **Weekly Exploration:** 1 medium-reward hobby — building skill or creativity (e.g., writing, gardening)
- **Occasional Push:** 1 high-reward hobby — challenge or thrill (e.g., presenting, traveling, competitive games)

**The idea:** Don't let your identity be tied only to high-reward hobbies. They burn fast. Let the low-reward ones shape who you are.
