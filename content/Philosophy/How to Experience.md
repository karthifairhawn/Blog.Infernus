It is common to think of experience itself as being of two kinds: sense experience, involving our five world-oriented senses, and reflective experience, including conscious awareness of our mental operations.

- Sense experience allows us to acquire knowledge of external objects.
- Awareness of our mental operations is responsible for the acquisition of knowledge of our minds

## Sense Experience
- It is generally agreed that most rationalists claim that there are significant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense experience.
