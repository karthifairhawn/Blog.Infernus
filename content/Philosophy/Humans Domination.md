In the biological system of earth we (humans) are over powered and we dominative all forms of other biological forms of earth. But a simple question is why ? 

**How we are over powered ?**
Every biological entity has some better factors compared to others.
- Elephant - Big
- Snake - Venomous
- Lion - The King
- Cheetah - The fastest
- Giraffe - Height
All these distributed powers balances the eco system expect one. Yes `The Humans`. They brought to earth with a ultra superficial power which is `Intelligence`.

**The worst invention ever**
I always blame the universe for inventing this trashy entity. When these guys are invented they started breaking the eco system. 

The world will be more beautiful without humans in earth. We almost crashed the earth entired behavior. Earth might never had a thought like a small biological entity(humans) can make this much negative impact on her system.
