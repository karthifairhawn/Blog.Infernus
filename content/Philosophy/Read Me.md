I invest time in philosophy research--- when I am down, depressed, bored or in emotional imbalance,

When I am in emotionally imbalance, I try to understand things and reflect a lot in vlogs, Paper and Art. On that time some philosophy research helps me a lot to properly reflect myself and in paper and to get some emotional Intelligence and to be honest there is where my Philosophy learning started and I believe I traveled on this for some what around 2 years.
