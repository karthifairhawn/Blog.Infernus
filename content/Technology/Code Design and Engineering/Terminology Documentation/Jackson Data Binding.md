## What is Jackson Data Binding ?

- It maps JSON data directly to Java objects and vice versa. This simplifies the data conversion process, eliminating the need for manual parsing and serialization. 
- For example and reference: [Click Me](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind?tab=readme-ov-file#1-minute-tutorial-pojos-to-json-and-back)

## Why Jackson ?

-  Working with POJOs instead of JSONObjects results in cleaner and more readable code. 
- We can use Java classes with meaningful field names and data types, promoting code readability.
- Jackson Data Binding leverages the type information present in Java classes, providing compile-time type safety.
- We can achieve high-performance data processing without compromising on code simplicity.
