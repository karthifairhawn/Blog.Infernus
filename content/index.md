Hey, I’m Karthi. A engineer, techie, aspirant athlete and someone who enjoys observing and experiencing life. `Thats a simple one liner about me`

**Why this blog?**
From childhood Itself I always try to log things in someway because I have fear of forgetting things. I still remember a day on that time i was doing 8th grade and I'm writing about gorillas in my last paper of maths note while watching NatGeo wild. 

I'm poor in memory power, I score very low marks, I think that top scoring students are scamming in some way that I don't. 

You got the point right I like to have more stuff in brain but it comes with a low size SDD so I started using external storage.

So possibly you got the point, I'm writing things  just to remember my thought processes and experiences forever.  I'm trying my maximum possible ways to log things that my brain process everyday.
