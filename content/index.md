Hey, I’m Karthi. A engineer, tech enthusiast, researcher, and someone who enjoys observing and experiencing life. This blog is my personal junkyard of thoughts—mostly for self-reflection, sometimes to share knowledge, but mainly just because I like documenting things.

I write about whatever interests me—philosophy, software development, rockets, space science, conspiracy theories, life experiences, and the occasional contradiction that keeps things interesting. My approach? A mix of reasoning and emotions, because I believe both drive us. Survival is a necessity, but life is about love—the most valuable feeling. I see the purpose of life as simple: to love and to be loved, and to make survival enjoyable along the way.

A few things about me:

- I spent random nights on stargazing.
- I do games for 12-16 hours straight. No regrets.
- Tea and Cake Pudding? The ultimate combo. 
- Jogging and Meditation gives me peace and satisfaction like nothing else.
- I often contradict my own points more than arguing with others—it’s how I learn.
- I'm trying hard to  understand the world and ideas better. I don’t care about taking sides or judgements; learning is my only objective.

I believe that every moment influences me—even this very second. I never think I know something completely, and I’m always open to being influenced, as long as there's proper reasoning behind it. I naturally connect with all kinds of people, even those whose traits I dislike, because I genuinely love learning.

If my life were a book, I’d call it:  
**"Wandering Thoughts: A Mind with No Destination."**

This blog doesn’t exist to teach or convince—it’s just a space for my thoughts to exist. Experience the world and its contradictions.

Welcome to **A Dumb Person’s Junkyard**—take what you need, leave what you don’t.
