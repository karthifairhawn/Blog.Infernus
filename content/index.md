## About Me ðŸ‘¾

Hi, I'm a Scorpio born lucky techie who works as a engineer at a software MNC and trying the best possible ways to learn and experience the world and it's philosophy.  I can easily set idea of me on you with few lines
- I believe 
	- Cosmos influences us and majorly driven by philosophy of cosmos.
	- Time travel is possible and obsessed with the idea of time dilation.
- Not a fan of marvel or DC. In fact never seen any films from Marvel or DC
- Worried about future of man kind and end of universe, Yup you're right I'm big fan of Mars Colonization so yes a fan of SpaceX too.
- I would say my purpose of life is to experience the existence and its attributes with love and care and other.
- I'm the Main Character of my experiences and communism is fair So I deal my life with empathy on my side characters who influence my experiences.

## Why this blog ?

Starting this blog as my second brain only, Meaning that there is no specific vision or idea on this blog.  How a average 75% academic student can store everything in brain. Impossible right ? So I'm just putting things here so I no more forget my experiences, dumb theories and philosophies.
