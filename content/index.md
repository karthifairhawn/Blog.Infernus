## TL;DR Fragments from a curious, unfinished mind.

### **Who am I?**
From a philosophical standpoint, I am still trying to answer this question. Self-discovery feels harder than any formal research.

For now, the simplest answer is this: I am a generalist someone who explores different domains that challenge how I think and live. I have depth in engineering and work as a software engineer by profession, but I don’t confine my curiosity to a single field.

I spend a lot of time learning across ideas, systems, philosophy, and abstractions. My writing probably explains me better than any fixed definition ever could.

And You can call me *Karthi*.

Thanks for being here. Happy reading.
### **Why do I write?**

Writing, for me, is a form of self-reflection and mental exploration. It helps me observe my own thought process more clearly.

Most of the time, I don’t revisit what I write after publishing it. Because of that, you may find rough edges, contradictions, or unfinished ideas. That’s intentional. These posts are snapshots of thinking in motion not polished conclusions.

I also use AI to help improve clarity and language. I don’t see it as outsourcing thought, but as a tool to translate what’s in my head onto the page more precisely.e
### **What does my writing contain?**

These writings are a collection of reflections, questions, and mental experiments. Topics may appear scattered

This blog isn’t about answers. It’s about thinking honestly in public.
